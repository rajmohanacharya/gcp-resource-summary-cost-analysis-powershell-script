## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have:

- **Google Cloud SDK** (`gcloud`) installed and authenticated
- **kubectl** installed and configured (for GKE cluster analysis)
- **PowerShell 5.1+** (Windows) or **PowerShell Core 7+** (Linux/macOS)
- Active **GCP project** with appropriate IAM permissions
- Internet connection (for live exchange rate API)

### Required GCP Permissions

Your account needs the following IAM roles:
- `roles/viewer` (Project-level read access)
- `roles/container.viewer` (GKE cluster access)
- `roles/billing.viewer` (Billing information access)

8. **Cost Analysis**
   - Compute, storage, and network costs
   - USD and INR pricing
   - Monthly, daily, hourly projections
   - Free trial burn rate

9. **Resource Access Guide**
   - External IP access instructions
   - kubectl connection commands

   - GCP Console quick links

## 🔧 Configuration

### Customize Exchange Rate

To use a different exchange rate or currency, modify the API endpoint:

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD"
$usdToInr = [math]::Round($response.rates.INR, 2)

Replace `INR` with your desired currency code (e.g., `EUR`, `GBP`, `JPY`).

### Adjust Cost Estimates

Cost calculations are based on standard GCP pricing. Update these variables in the script:

$computeCostPerNode = 24.50 # e2-medium cost
$diskCostPerGB = 0.040 # Standard persistent disk
$lbMonthlyCost = 18.00 # Per forwarding rule
